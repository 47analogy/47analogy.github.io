KISS is important to me because it helps to not complicate things. For example, when I’m starting a new project, I try to form a plan of action (usually by writing some ideas on paper). It’s usually when I’m sitting in front of a blank code editor page that I start scratching my head on where to begin, or how to begin, or what to do first...you get the idea. With so many possible paths, it’s so easy to feel overwhelmed to the point that I start trying to do several different things. Trying to solve several new problems all at once, especially if I still need to do more research, rarely turns out well."),o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Implementing KISS"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"This is where KISS comes into play for me. By having an end goal of keeping things simple, it forces me to break things down into smaller pieces.
