Through the use of a virtual DOM, React identifies what has changed, compares it to the actual DOM, and then reconciles or updates the changes as to what the user sees on the screen. I’m very familiar with React and it’s my go-to library for building user interfaces for single page applications."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"I’ve always heard about D3 and how it’s a very powerful library that can be used to create interactive visual representations of data by using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), HTML and CSS to manipulate the DOM. One advantage of using D3 is that it offers a lot of low-level control for how a page looks, which is great because it doesn’t restrict what you can or want to do with it."),"The biggest issue I had wrapping my mind around when first trying to work with these two is how can it be possible for both of them to co-exist in the same app?
