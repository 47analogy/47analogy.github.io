I’m very familiar\n            with React and it’s my go-to library for building user interfaces\n            for single page applications.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I’ve always heard about D3 and how it’s a very powerful library that\n            can be used to create interactive visual representations of data by\n            using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), HTML and CSS to manipulate the\n            DOM. One advantage of using D3 is that it offers a lot of low-level\n            control for how a page looks, which is great because it doesn’t\n            restrict what you can or want to do with it.\n          </p>\n          The biggest issue I had wrapping my mind around when first trying to\n          work with these two is how can it be possible for both of them to\n          co-exist in the same app? One uses snap-shots and comparisons to\n          update the DOM and the other updates it directly. For example, if I\n          change something directly using D3, how would React know it was\n          changed before a re-render?\n          <p />\n          <p>\n            Turns out, there are many different opinions on this topic, as well\n            as ways to integrate them. Being more familiar with React, my\n            initial approaches have been using D3 to assist with the drawing,\n            but keeping track of state in React to render.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As an example, say if I wanted to draw a map of the United States.\n          </p>\n          <img id='usa-map-img' src={usaMapImg} alt='usa map' />\n          <div className='code-example'>\n            <div className='text-wrap'>\n              <h3>In a nutshell:</h3>\n              <p>\n                The map data in statesmap.json comes from a static GeoJSON file,\n                which is used by d3-geo (\n                <a href='https://github.com/d3/d3-geo'>\n                  https://github.com/d3/d3-geo\n                </a>\n                ) to translate the data to map coordinates via the geoAlbersUSA\n                projection.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                After the component mounts and the React state is updated, the d\n                attribute on the path element outlines the shape of each state\n                as it's drawn in the render method, using a SVG tag. D3 does not\n                interact with the DOM directly.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Allowing React to be in the driver’s seat works and aligns with\n                how I’m used to working with React. If I want to make the map\n                interactive, it's easy to create events and update React state.\n                However, I quickly came to realize some disadvantages.\n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                    There’s a wealth of information and examples about using D3\n                    available, but it would take some work to try and convert\n                    these to the <i>\"React way\"</i>, not to mention having to\n                    keep track of and updating everything in state.{' '}\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Part of the advantage of using D3 is its quick updating and\n                    flexibility (especially when it comes to user interactions).\n                    I felt like I was losing a lot of this by not allowing D3 to\n                    have a more active role to update elements with the DOM\n                    directly.\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                In another post, I’ll talk about another approach that I’ve come\n                across recently...one that I feel better balances the “best\n                parts” of using these two libraries together.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <img id='usa-snippet-img' src={usaMapCodeImg} alt='code snippet' />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className='home-link'>\n        <Link to='/'>Go back to the landing page</Link>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default ReactD3Blog\n","import React from 'react'\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types'\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet'\nimport './layout.css'\nimport favicon from '../assets/favicon.ico'\n\nconst Layout = ({ children }) => (\n  <div>\n    <Helmet\n      title=\"Anthony Tweed\"\n      meta={[\n        { name: 'description', content: 'portfolio' },\n        { name: 'keywords', content: 'anthony, tweed' },\n      ]}\n      link={[{ rel: 'shortcut icon', type: 'image/png', href: `${favicon}` }]}\n    />\n    <div>{children}</div>\n  </div>\n)\n\nLayout.propTypes = {\n  children: PropTypes.object,\n}\n\nexport default Layout\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/favicon-783d329bfcf170948b20f63499ada3b3.ico\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/usa-map-snippet_1-2f5e876b12a3034e6e372542e9cacbf6.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/usa-map_1-8bc4319120a65c03e5dab349ad6426ae.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
